    What is Basic Service?
  </div>

  <p>
    Your <i>electric service</i> has two components:
    <ul class="list-unstyled" >
      <li>
        <i>Supply</i> - Generation and procurement of the electricity you use
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Delivery</i> - Transmission and distribution of the electricity to your home or business
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    The electricity <i>supplied</i> by National Grid is known as <b><i>Basic Service</i></b>.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the past, only your electric utility could provide your electricity supply.
    But now, under MA state law, consumers can choose a supplier other than their utility.
    In this case, the utility would continue to deliver the electricity, maintain poles and wires, and provide other customer services; and customers would continue to receive a single electric bill from their utility.
  </p>

  <p>
    Today, most residents and businesses subscribe to their utility's Basic Service.
    <a href="/?page=overview" >Community Choice Aggregation</a> is a state program that permits a town to choose, on behalf of its residents and businesses, a supplier other than the utility.
    At CCA inception, Basic Service subscribers who do not <i>opt out</i> are automatically enrolled with the new supplier, with the ability to leave without penalty at any time.
