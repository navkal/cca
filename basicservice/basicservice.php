    What is Basic Service?
  </p>

  <p>
    Your electric service has two components:
    <ul class="list-unstyled" >
      <li>
        <b>Supply</b> - Generation and procurement of the electricity you use
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Delivery</b> - Transmission and distribution of the electricity to your home or business
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    The electricity <i>supplied</i> by National Grid is known as <b><i>Basic Service</i></b>.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the past, only your electric utility could provide your electricity supply.
    But now, under MA state law, consumers can choose a supplier other than their utility.
    In this case, the utility would continue to deliver the electricity, maintain poles and wires, and provide other customer services; and customers would continue to receive a single electric bill from their utility.
  </p>

  <p>
    Today, most residents and businesses subscribe to their utility's Basic Service.
    <a href="/?page=overview" >Community Choice Aggregation</a> is a state program that permits a town to choose an electricity supplier on behalf of its residents and businesses.
    Consumers who subscribe to Basic Service are automatically enrolled with the ability to opt out at any time with no penalty.
