    Community Choice Aggregation (CCA)
  </p>

  <p>
    Many of Andover’s residents and businesses wish to be able to purchase renewable energy at a competitive price.  <i>Community Choice Aggregation</i> (CCA) is a state-regulated program that addresses this growing demand by consumers to choose their source of electricity.  Also known as <i>Municipal Aggregation</i>, the program authorizes a municipality to purchase electricity in bulk from competitive suppliers on behalf of the community.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through CCA, Andover would be able to purchase energy with a higher renewable content than required by the Massachusetts Renewable Portfolio Standard, in keeping with the town's values as a designated Massachusetts Green Community.
  </p>

  <p>
    CCA offers the following potential benefits to consumers:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Lower rates
      </li>
      <li>
        Increased renewable portfolio
      </li>
      <li>
        Rate stability
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    The program will give participants greater control over their electricity supply by offering multiple options for their electricity mix as well as the ability to leave the program and return to National Grid’s Basic Service at any time with no penalty or fee.  For all customers, National Grid will continue to be the distributor and billing agent.
