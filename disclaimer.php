      A goal of the aggregation program is to produce savings for customers, but savings cannot be guaranteed compared to the utilityâ€™s basic service rate, which changes every six months for Residential and Small Business customers and every three months for Large Business customers.
      The aggregation program seeks to provide price stability and average savings over the full term of the program, but because future basic service rates are not known, there is no guarantee of savings.
