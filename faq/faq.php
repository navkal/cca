            CCA is a Massachusetts state-regulated program that came out of the Restructuring Act of 1997, specifically <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXXII/Chapter164/Section134" target="_blank">Chapter 164, Section 134</a>.  The law was enacted to ensure that the benefits of energy deregulation would be passed on to residential and business electricity customers.
          </p>

          <p>
            CCA empowers cities and towns to create large buying groups of these customers in order to seek bids for cheaper supply rates.  By grouping electricity customer accounts within municipal boundaries, CCA creates economies of scale, enabling participating cities and towns to achieve savings for account holders as a whole.

            Initially, if you get your supply from National Grid Basic Service, you will be switched automatically to the program\'s default supply option.  If the program offers other options - for example, with higher or lower renewable content than the default - you can switch (<i>opt up</i> or <i>opt down</i>) at any time.  You can also return to National Grid Basic Service (<i>opt out</i>) at any time, without penalty or cost.

After you re-enroll, the CCA program rate will appear on your utility bill in the next available billing cycle.

          <p>
            Once enrolled in CCA, you will continue to receive one bill for both delivery and supply from National Grid, and National Grid will continue to provide the same level of service as before.  While CCA aims to offer favorable supply prices, savings relative to National Grid Basic Service is not guaranteed, due to potential fluctuations in National Grid pricing.

          </p>
          <p>
            Beware of scams.  Before agreeing to purchase electricity from a TPS, you should read the complete contract fine print and have a clear understanding of rate details and any termination penalties.

The programs go by different names in different states, but the bulk-purchasing principles upon which they operate are largely the same.  By aggregating a large number of electric accounts together, the programs create economies of scale, enabling participating municipalities to reap savings for electricity consumers within their borders.'
