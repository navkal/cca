    What is Community Choice Aggregation?
  </div>

  <p>
    <i>Community Choice Aggregation</i> (CCA) is a state-regulated program that addresses a growing demand by Massachusetts electricity consumers to purchase renewable energy at competitive prices.  Also known as <i>Municipal Aggregation</i>, the program authorizes a municipality to negotiate prices and terms with competing electricity suppliers on behalf of the community.  One hundred forty-six Massachusetts towns and cities already participate in this program today.  Andover should, too.
  </p>

  <p>
    CCA offers the following potential benefits to consumers:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Rate stability
      </li>
      <li>
        Increased renewable portfolio
      </li>
      <li>
        Lower rates
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    Through CCA, Andover would be able to purchase energy with a higher renewable content than required by the Massachusetts Renewable Portfolio Standard, in keeping with the town's values as a designated Massachusetts Green Community.
  </p>

  <p>
    The program would give consumers greater control over the price and content of their electricity supply by offering one or more alternatives to National Grid <a href="/?page=basicservice" ><i>Basic Service</i></a>.  It would also allow customers to resume National Grid Basic Service at any time, with no penalty or fee.  For all customers, National Grid would continue to be the distributor and billing agent.
